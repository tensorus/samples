# Tensorus Demo Page

This repository contains the frontend application for showcasing demos of **Tensorus**, an agentic tensor database. This page is built using React and Vite.

## Current Status

Currently, this application serves as a foundational template (boilerplate) based on `create-vite` with the React plugin. The immediate future scope is to develop this page into a showcase for the various Tensorus conceptual demos, such as the "Financial News Impact Demo" and the "Smart Story Analyzer Demo," which can be found in the parent directory of this project.

## Getting Started / How to Run This Page

To get this React application running locally, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or yarn:** These package managers come with Node.js (npm) or can be installed separately (yarn).

### Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone the main Tensorus repository that contains this project.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository_name> # Replace <repository_name> with the cloned directory name
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Demo Page Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tensorus-demo-page
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  **View in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port). You should see the default Vite + React application page.

## Future Scope

*   Integrate clear navigation to access or embed the Streamlit-based Tensorus demos.
*   Provide summaries and explanations for each demo.
*   Develop a user-friendly interface to explore the concepts Tensorus aims to illustrate.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the development of this demo page or the Tensorus project, please follow the standard open-source contribution guidelines (e.g., fork the repository, create a feature branch, submit a pull request).
